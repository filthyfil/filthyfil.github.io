        <section>
          <h2>preface</h2>
          <p>during the peak of LLM hype, i wanted to explore their limits. what makes them effective, where they fail, and how they could be improved.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Iterative Thought & Self-Reprompting -->
        <section>
          <h2>iterative thought & self-reprompting</h2>
          <p>one idea i explored was using another LLM to rephrase and iterate on outputsâ€”mimicking the way we internally reason through ideas before expressing them.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Role-Based Approach -->
        <section>
          <h2>role-based approach</h2>
          <p>inspired by neural network batching, i tried dividing reasoning into specialized roles. different prompts framed LLMs as critics, creators, or analyzers, etc to see if this reduced problems and improved coherence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>use cases</h2>
            <p>i also used LLMs to perform agentic tasks, for example in the IOT smart home-esque setting. this worked well and is actually pretty useful. the downside is running these models 24/7 is expensive, and migitating it has a massive effect on convenience of use.</p>

        <!-- Challenges & Lessons -->
        <section>
          <h2>outcome</h2>
          <p>while the LLMs showed adaptability, they struggled with maintaining long-term coherence and generating novelty. the usual problems</p>
