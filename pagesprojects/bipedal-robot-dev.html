        <section>
          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>When I was a kid, I loved Star Wars, especially the droids. Seeing how modern robotics is evolving, I wanted to build something of my own.</p>

        <!-- Project Outline -->
        <section>
          <h2>Project Outline</h2>
          <p>Inspired by BD-1 from *Star Wars: The Fallen Order*, I began designing a bipedal robot.</p>

        <!-- CAD Modeling -->
        <section>
          <h2>CAD Design</h2>
          <p>After several iterations in Fusion360, I finalized the design:</p>

        <!-- Simulation -->
        <section>
          <h2>Simulation</h2>
          <p>The model was imported into a physics simulation to test its movement and stability.</p>

        <!-- Training -->
        <section>
          <h2>Training</h2>
          <p>The robot's movement was refined using reinforcement learning. After many iterations, it finally took its first step.</p>
